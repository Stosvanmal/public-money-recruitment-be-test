Software I use to use:

EntityFramework,
Autofac,
Automapper,
Dapper

I didnt configure this nuggets in the startup because in every version of framework/core changes.

I created a folders called Services, there you can create a service to reuse some code, for this mini test I didn't create, for a large aplicacions I love to use services.

The infrastructure layer I didn't create a generic repository and I create just one, just to make the tasks...

No integration test needed.
